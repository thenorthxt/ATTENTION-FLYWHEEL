# Attention Flywheel

ATTENTION FLYWHEEL is a feedback loop where **attention drives the system**.

Rather than treating attention as marketing or noise, this design makes attention a **measurable input** that directly influences economic behavior.

The more attention the system receives,  
the more it responds through buybacks and burn.

---

## Core Thesis

**Attention is not a byproduct.  
It is the signal.**

Most systems react to price or volume.  
Attention Flywheel reacts to **observation itself**.

Watching is not passive.  
It participates in the loop.

---

## The Attention Flywheel

The mechanism is built around a single variable: **attention density**.

### High-level loop

1. **Attention is measured**  
   (watchers, holders, views, observers, active interest)

2. **Higher attention increases activity**  
   (more interactions, more participation)

3. **Activity generates protocol fees**

4. **Fees trigger automated buybacks**

5. **A portion of buybacks is burned**  
   (supply reduction scales with attention)

6. **Reduced supply reinforces price memory and visibility**

7. **Visibility attracts more attention**

The loop closes.

Attention feeds activity.  
Activity funds buybacks.  
Buybacks reward attention.

## Attention as a Variable

Attention is treated as a **first-class signal**, not a narrative metric.

Possible inputs (implementation-dependent):
- number of holders
- number of watchers / subscribers
- on-chain activity observers
- off-chain views or mentions
- composite attention score

The system does not care *who* watches.  
Only **how many eyes remain present**.

---

## Design Principles

- No forced campaigns  
- No artificial spikes  
- No attention wasted  

The system responds proportionally:
- more attention → stronger response
- less attention → quieter behavior

This creates a natural equilibrium where attention is **earned, not extracted**.

---

## Philosophy

Attention Flywheel favors:
- presence over noise
- persistence over virality
- observation over speculation

Growth is not measured by peaks,  
but by how long attention stays.

When people keep watching,  
the system keeps responding.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — mechanism explanations, parameter definitions, narrative
- `scripts/` — simulations and attention → buyback models
- `programs/` — future on-chain logic and automation
- `apps/` — dashboards and attention tracking tools
- `packages/` — reusable primitives

---

## Status

This repository documents the **design and experimentation phase**.

All mechanics described here are subject to iteration, simulation, and formalization.

The flywheel is intentionally simple.  
The complexity emerges from attention itself.

---

## Closing

ATTENTION FLYWHEEL is not about being loud.

It is about being watched.

As long as attention stays,  
the loop continues.
